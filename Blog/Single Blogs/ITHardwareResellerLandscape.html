                            IT hardware reseller.</strong></em>
                </p>

                <span class="points">Price Competition:</span>
                <p>This is a big challenge for any hardware reseller in the
                    digital industry as the market is growing, customers are
                    more informed and tend to explore multiple sources to
                    purchase their desired product, this factor has initiated
                    the price war, every shop owner or reseller is struggling to
                    increase their buyers and offer minimum prices, this intense
                    and high competition has already impacted the price margins.
                    Most customers are focusing on economical purchasing of the
                    products, thus after so much hard work, profit margins are
                    not satisfying for most IT hardware resellers.</p>
                <br />
                <span class="points">Dependency on Suppliers:</span>
                <p>As we know resellers are the middleman between manufacturers
                    and end-users, so they are highly dependable on the
                    distributor and manufacturer, any kind of disruptions and
                    irregularities in the supply chain can impact the market of
                    the reseller, and their name can be at stake because user
                    mostly blame the reseller for any kind of faulty, damaged or
                    old version products.</p>
                <br />
                <span class="points">Changing Trends:</span>
                <p>The IT landscape is continuously evolving and manufacturers
                    are always in a race to produce different, latest, and
                    upgraded versions of their products, These technological
                    advancements can be challenging and force the resellers to
                    adapt to the changes, to ensure the up-to-date solutions to
                    remain competitive and reputable in the market.
                </p>
                <br />
                <span class="points">Limited Profits:</span>
                <p>Resellers have to maintain their business models even if they
                    sell products at thin margins.
                </p>
                <br />
                <span class="points">Customer High Expectations and Support:</span>
                <p>Customers want comprehensive support, warranties, and
                    post-sales services. These services
                    can drain the resellers and service providers, and cost big
                    to small structured and new resellers.As if they do not
                    offer such additional services to customers, they can not
                    grow and become successful in the market. this is the big
                    con for any resellers and new persons planning to join this
                    industry as a reseller. Sometimes customers come with issues
                    and ask for a return or exchange, this thing can also
                    provide massive constraints.
                </p>
                <br />
                <span class="points">Inventory Management Challenges:</span>
                <p>Resellers and online stores often find themselves in
                    conflicts with manufacturers and distributors as some
                    manufacturers cross the middleman option and become direct
                    sellers. Another disadvantage for resellers is maintaining
                    the inventory and in-stock products because the
                    technological advancements enable the customers to go for
                    the latest items and arrange, selling the previous task can
                    be daunting for shopowners and IT hardware resellers, so
                    overstocking can lead to potential financial losses and
                    understocking can miss the good sales opportunity and
                    inconvenience to customers.
                </p>
                <br />
                <span class="points">Market Saturation:</span>
                <p>This market is highly saturated and competent and investing
                    in such a market and standing out as a best reseller is a
                    difficult journey and businessmen should be expert, smart,
                    and proficient in market analysis to attract and retain
                    customers. There are List of software resellers and hardware
