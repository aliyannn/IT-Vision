    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000;">When
        dealing with any damaged or malfunctioning products covered by a
        manufacturer's warranty, you must first contact the manufacturer,
        who
        may be able to assess the issue and provide a solution without the
        need
        for a return. If a return is required, you must include the
        manufacturer's
        call reference number, a test report, and/or an accurate customer
        description. Please email <a style="color: #000000;"
            href="mailto:returns@itvisionnetworks.com" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">returns@itvisionnetworks.com</a> for guidance in
        each
        situation.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1) A complete description of the fault is necessary; a fault
            description of
            "it does not work," "faulty," or "DOA" is insufficient.</li>
        <li>2) A minimum 15% restocking fee will be assessed unless the
            items are
            returned in their original packaging, with all of the
            accessories,
            manuals, and documentation included (being a percentage of the
            value of
            the goods). Please note that this amount could be raised if
            necessary to
            reflect our loss more accurately.</li>
        <li>3) If returned items are confirmed to be in perfect condition, a
            minimum
            15% restocking fee will apply (being a percentage of the value
            of the
            goods). Please note that this amount may be raised to reflect a
            fair
            evaluation of our loss. The restocking fee percentage will be
            confirmed
            to you after receipt of your returned goods and will be based on
            a
            numeral of factors, including the amount of labor required and
            the state
            of the packing and contents.</li>
        <li>4) The costs of returning the goods by delivery are your
            responsibility.</li>

        items will be examined and tested by us. Once the problem has been

        or
        replacement once the problem has been confirmed. Whether a repair or
        replacement is offered is entirely up to our discretion.</p>
