                illustrative and shall not limit the understanding of the words
                before those terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) CONTRACTUAL GROUNDS</h2>

        <p><strong>2.1. </strong>The Order represents a customer's offer to buy
            products and/or services per these conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>2.2. </strong>The Contract will only be deemed entered when
            the
            Supplier issues a written acceptance of the Order, at which point
            and on
            that date (Commencement Date).</p>

        <p><strong>2.3. </strong>The parties' Agreement is outlined in full in
            the
            Contract. The Customer acknowledges that it has not relied on any
            representation, assurance, guarantee, or warranty that has not been
            included in the Contract and has been made by or on behalf of the
            Supplier.</p>

        <p><strong>2.4. </strong>The sole purpose of any samples, drawings,
            descriptive materials, or advertising provided by the Supplier, as
            well
            as any descriptions of the Goods, illustrations, or descriptions of
            the
            Services posted on the Supplier's website, is to provide a general
            idea
            of the Services and/or Goods they are describing. They are not
            intended
            to be a component of the Agreement or to have any legal effect.</p>

        <p><strong>2.5. </strong>To the exclusion of all additional terms that
            the
            Customer seeks to impose or integrate or which are implied by trade,
            custom, practice, or course of business, the Contract is subject
            only to
            the provisions of this clause.</p>

        <p><strong>2.6. </strong>Subject to stock availability, any quotation
            made
            by the Supplier shall not be deemed an offer and shall only be good
            for
            the Business Day on which it is made.</p>

        <p><strong>2.7. </strong>Except when applied to one or the other state,
            all
            these conditions will apply to the supply of goods and services.</p>

        <h2>3) GOODS</h2>

        <p><strong>3.1. </strong>The Goods are detailed in the quotation, Order,
            or
            Goods Specification.</p>

        <p><strong>3.2. </strong>If necessary to comply with any relevant
            statutory
            or regulatory requirements, the Supplier has the right to modify the
            Products Specification.</p>

        <h2>4) TRANSFER OF GOODS</h2>

        <p> <strong>4.1. </strong>The Supplier shall make sure that each
            shipment of
            Goods is accompanied by a delivery note that includes the date of
            the
            Order, all pertinent Customer and Supplier reference numbers, the
            type
            and quantity of the Goods (including the Goods' code number, where
            applicable), and special storage instructions (if any).</p>

        <p><strong>4.2. </strong>The Supplier shall deliver the Products at any
            time following the Supplier's notification to the Customer that the
            Goods are available to the Delivery Location specified in the Order
            or
            such other location as the parties may agree.</p>

        <p><strong>4.3. </strong>When the goods arrive at the delivery location,
            delivery of the goods is complete.</p>

        <p><strong>4.4. </strong>The Customer shall inspect the Items within 48
            hours after delivery completion. The Customer must report the
            following
            to the Supplier within 48 hours: As long as the specific
            requirements of
            our return policy are followed, and the necessary written
            notification
            is given to the courier at the time of receipt of visibly damaged
            goods,
            we will accept returns for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The incorrect quantity of goods has been delivered.</li>
            <li>The faulty goods have been delivered.</li>
            <li>The goods' specifications have not been met.</li>
            <li>The goods have been delivered in any way that is visible upon
                delivery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.5.</strong> Any delivery dates given for the goods are
            estimates, and delivery time is not crucial. When a Force Majeure
            Event
            prevents the delivery of the Goods or the Customer fails to give the
            Supplier sufficient delivery instructions or other instructions that
            are
            important to the provision of the Goods, the Supplier is not
            responsible.</p>

        <p><strong>4.6. </strong>If the Supplier cannot deliver the Products,
            its
            liability shall be restricted to the costs and expenses paid by the
            Customer in locating comparable replacement goods in the least
            expensive
            market, less the Price of the Goods. Suppose the Customer fails to
            give
            the Supplier proper delivery instructions for the goods or any other
            pertinent instruction regarding the supply of the goods. In that
            case,
            the Supplier shall not be liable for any failure to deliver the
            goods to
            the extent that a Force Majeure Event causes such failure.</p>

        <p> <strong>4.7. </strong>Over 5 Business Days, the Supplier will make a
            maximum of two efforts to deliver the goods.</p>

        <p><strong>4.8. </strong>If the Customer does not accept or take
            delivery
            of the Products within 5 Business Days of receiving a notification
            from
            the Supplier that the Goods are ready, then, barring Force Majeure
            Events or the Supplier's breach of its obligations under the
            Contract
            concerning the Goods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Supplier shall store the Goods until delivery takes place
                and charge the Customer for all related costs, warehouse
                charges, and expenses.</li>
            <li>Delivery of the Goods shall be deemed to have occurred at 9:00
                am on the first Business Day following the day the Supplier
                notified the Customer that the Goods were ready (including
                insurance).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4.9. </strong>The Supplier may resell, return to the
            Manufacturer, or otherwise dispose of part or all of the Goods if
            the
            Customer fails to take or accept a delivery within 5 Business Days
            of
            the Supplier notifying the Customer that they were ready for
            delivery.
            After deducting reasonable storage, selling, delivery, postage,
            restocking, and administration costs, the Supplier will account to
            the
            Customer for any excess over the Price of the Goods or charge the
            Customer for any shortfall.</p>

        <p><strong>4.10.</strong> If the Supplier provides more or fewer goods
            than
            the Customer ordered, the Customer cannot reject the goods. However,
            if
            the Customer notifies the Supplier that the improper amount of goods
            was
            delivered, a pro-rata adjustment will be made to the order invoice.</p>

        <p><strong>4.11. </strong>The Supplier can supply the goods in
            installments, each of which must be separately invoiced and paid
            for.
            There will be a separate contract for each installment. The Customer
            shall not be entitled to cancel any other installment or withhold
            payment of any other delivered installment due to any delay in
            delivery
            or defect in any installment.</p>

        <h2>5) QUALITY OF GOODS</h2>

        <p><strong>5.1. </strong>The Supplier guarantees that the goods will:
            According to the Sale of Goods Act of 1979, the goods must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be of satisfactory quality.</li>
            <li>Conform in all material respects to their description and any
                applicable Goods Specification.</li>
            <li>Be free from material design, material, and workmanship flaws.</li>
            <li>Be suitable for any purpose specified by the Supplier.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>5.2. </strong>Following section 5.3, if the Customer notifies
            the Manufacturer in writing within a reasonable period after
            discovering
            that some or all of the goods do not meet the warranty outlined in
            clause 5.1, the Customer contacts the Manufacturer directly to
            discuss
            fixing or replacing the defective goods; the Supplier is given a
            reasonable opportunity to examine the goods; and the Customer
            returns
            the goods to the Supplier (if requested by the Supplier).</p>

        <p><strong>5.3. </strong>The Supplier won't be held responsible if the
            products don't live up to the warranty in clause 5.1 if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The defect results from the Customer failing to follow the
                Supplier's oral or written instructions regarding the storage,
                installation, commissioning, use, or maintenance of the Goods or
                (if there are none) good trade practices; the defect results
                from the Supplier following any drawing, design, or Goods
                Specification supplied by the Customer; the Customer modifies
                the Goods in any way after giving a notice following clause 5.2;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>5.4. </strong>Other than what is stated in this clause 5, the
            Supplier is not responsible for the Products' failure to live up to
            the
            warranty outlined in article 5.1.</p>

        <p><strong>5.5. </strong>Any repaired or replacement goods provided by
            the
            Supplier under section 5.2 shall be subject to the provisions of
            these
            Terms.</p>

        <h2>6) TITLE & RISK</h2>

        <p><strong>6.1.</strong> Upon successful delivery, the Client will own
            the
            Items.</p>

        <p><strong>6.2. </strong>After the Supplier receives complete payment
            (in
            cash or cleared funds, including any interest and TAX) for the Goods
            for
            which payment has become due, title to the Goods will transfer to
            the
            Customer at that time.</p>

        <p><strong>6.3.</strong> The Customer must follow these obligations up
            until the title to the goods has passed to them: To ensure that the
            Goods are easily distinguishable as the Supplier's property, the
            Customer must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Store the Goods separately from all other goods held by the
                Customer;</li>
            <li>Not remove, deface, or obscure any identifying mark or packaging
                on or relating to the Goods;</li>
            <li>Not incorporate or affix the Goods to any other products,
                including software, ROM, RAM, hardware, or other media; and</li>
            <li>Keep the Goods in good condition and maintain insurance on the
                Sup for their full Price against all risks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>6.4. </strong>In cases where the Customer has been granted
            credit terms, the Customer may resell or use the Goods in the usual
            course of its business (but not otherwise) before the Supplier
            receives
            payment for the Products. But if the Customer sells the goods again
            before then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The title to the Products will transfer from the Supplier to the
                Customer just before the moment the Customer resells them, and
                it does so as principal and not as the Supplier's agent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>6.5. </strong>Without limiting the Supplier's other rights or
            remedies, if any of the events specified in article 13.2 or failure
            to
            make payment for the goods following clause 9 occur before title to
            the
            goods passes to the Customer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Supplier may demand that the Customer deliver all Goods that
                have not been resold or irrevocably incorporated into another
                product. Suppose the Customer fails to do so promptly. In that
                case, the Supplier may enter any premises of the Customer or any
                third party where the Goods are stored to recover them,
                including dismantling any product.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7) SUPPLY OF SERVICES</h2>

        <p><strong>7.1.</strong> The Supplier shall perform the Services for the
            Customer in all material aspects in line with the Service
            Specification.</p>

        <p><strong>7.2.</strong> The Supplier shall use its best efforts to
            provide
            the Services by the dates specified in the Order, but any such dates
            are
            only estimates, and there is no deadline for completing the
            Services.</p>

        <p><strong>7.3. </strong>The Supplier shall have the right to make any
            changes to the Services that are required to comply with any
            relevant
            legislation or safety requirement or that do not materially alter
            the
            nature or quality of the Services, and the Supplier shall give the
            Customer notice if this occurs.</p>

        <p><strong>7.4. </strong>The Supplier guarantees that the Services will
            be
            delivered to the Customer with reasonable care and skill.</p>

        <h2>8) CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS</h2>

        <p><strong>8.1. </strong>The Customer shall:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Confirm that the terms of the Order and the Products
                Specification (if provided by the Customer) are correct and
                complete;</li>

                upon receipt. The Customer shall return all Materials and
                Deliverables provided by the Supplier that has not yet been
                fully paid for. The Supplier may access the Customer's premises
                and take ownership of them if the Customer doesn't comply. The
                parties' accrued rights and remedies as of termination shall not
                be affected, including the right to seek damages for any breach
                of the Contract that existed at or before the date of
                termination or expiration and clauses that expressly or by
                implication have effect after termination shall be followed.
                Until they are returned, the Customer shall be solely
                responsible for their safekeeping and will not use them for any
                purpose unrelated to this Contract.</li>

        <h2>15) FORCE MAJEURE</h2>

        <p><strong>15.1. </strong>For this Contract, a "Force Majeure Event"
            occurs
            beyond the Supplier's reasonable control. Examples of such
            occurrences
            include accidents, break-ins, riots, war, civil unrest, strikes,
            lockouts, or other labor disputes (whether involving the Supplier's
            workforce or that of any other party), failure of a utility service
            or
            transportation network, act of God, war, riot, civil unrest, and
            malicious damage.</p>

        <p><strong>15.2. </strong>If a Force Majeure Event causes the Supplier
            to
            delay or fail to perform its duties under this Contract, the
            Supplier
            will not be held responsible to the Customer.</p>

        <p><strong>15.3. </strong>The Supplier shall have the right, without
            limiting any other rights or remedies, to terminate this Contract
            immediately by giving written notice to the Customer if the Force
            Majeure Event prohibits the Supplier from supplying any of the
            Services
            and/or Products for longer than two weeks.</p>

                assigned, transferred, mortgaged, charged, subcontracted, or

        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>Any notice or other communication given to a party under or in
                connection with this Contract must be in writing, addressed to
                that party at its registered office (if it is a company),
                principal place of business (in any other case), or such other
                address as that party may have specified to the other party in

                be deemed received when left at the address specified in clause
                12.2(a); if sent by prepaid first-class mail or another next-day
                delivery service at 9.00 am on the second Business Day following

            <li>Any proceedings or other documents that are served as part of a
                legal action are exempt from the rules of this article.</li>
            <li>Suppose any clause or portion of a clause in the Contract is
                found invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable. In that case, it
                shall be deemed changed to the least degree necessary to render
                it valid, unlawful, and enforceable. The relevant provision or
                part-provision shall be eliminated if such alteration is not
                practicable. The legality and enforceability of the remaining
                provisions of the Contract shall not be impacted by the

                or part-provision of this Contract that is unlawful, invalid, or
                unenforceable and that, to the greatest degree practicable,
                achieves the intended commercial result of the original
                provision.</li>
            <li><strong>16.3</strong> Severance.</li>
            <li>Suppose any clause or portion of a clause in the Contract is
                found invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable. In that case, it
                shall be deemed changed to the least degree necessary to render
                it valid, unlawful, and enforceable. The relevant provision or
                part-provision shall be eliminated if such alteration is not
                practicable. The legality and enforceability of the remaining
                provisions of the Contract shall not be impacted by the
                modification or deletion of any provision or part-provision
                under this section.</li>
            <li>The parties shall negotiate in good faith to alter any provision
                or part-provision of this Contract that is unlawful, invalid, or
                unenforceable and that, to the greatest degree practicable,

                provision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.4. </strong>Waiver. Any
            waiver of a right under the Contract or the law must be in writing
            to be effective, and it cannot be interpreted to cover future
            infractions or defaults. Neither party's failure or delay in
            exercising a right or remedy granted by the Contract or by law
            constitutes a waiver of that or any other rights or remedies, nor
            does it bar or restrict that party from subsequently exercising
            those rights or remedies. The exercise of such right or remedy in
            full or in part shall not preclude or limit the exercise of that
            right or remedy or any other right or remedy.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.5. </strong>No agency or
            cooperation. Nothing in the Contract shall be construed as creating
            a partnership or joint venture between any of the parties, nor shall
            it designate either party as acting as the agent of another party.
            No party shall have the power or authority to bind the other party
            in any manner or to serve as its agent.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.6</strong> External parties.
            A third party, not a party to the Contract, cannot enforce any of
            its provisions.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.7. </strong>Change. No
            modification to the Contract, including the addition of any new
            terms and conditions, shall be valid unless approved in writing and
            signed by a Director of the Supplier, except as provided in these
            Conditions.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.8</strong> The rule of law.
            The law of England and Wales shall govern this Agreement and any
            controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its
            subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or
            claims).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.9. </strong>Jurisdiction.
            Each party irrevocably agrees that any dispute or claim arising out
            of or in connection with this Contract or its subject matter or
            formation shall be exclusively brought before the courts of England
            and Wales (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</p>
